# Alphabet AR Project

The Alphabet AR Project is an augmented reality (AR) application designed for educational purposes, specifically targeted for placement showcases. It allows users to interact with animated 3D models corresponding to each letter of the alphabet using AR technology.

## Features

- **AR Experience**: Utilizes AR.js and A-Frame to provide an immersive AR experience directly in the user's web browser.
- **Interactive 3D Models**: Each letter from A to Z is associated with a unique 3D model that users can interact with in AR.
- **Marker-based Detection**: Uses custom pattern markers (`*.patt` files) for accurate and reliable detection of each letter's AR content.
- **Marker Download**: Provides a dedicated page where users can download and print markers for offline use.
- **Simple Navigation**: Easy navigation between different sections of the project via a clear and intuitive interface.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key components:

- **Homepage (`index.html`)**: Introduces the project and provides navigation links to other sections.
- **AR Experience Page (`ar-experience.html`)**: Displays the AR scene with interactive 3D models for each letter.
- **Download Markers Page (`download-markers.html`)**: Allows users to download marker files (`*.patt`) for printing.
- **Stylesheet (`styles.css`)**: CSS file for consistent styling across all pages.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open each HTML file (`index.html`, `ar-experience.html`, `download-markers.html`) in a web browser that supports AR.js and A-Frame.
3. Ensure that the markers (`*.patt` files) are stored in the `markers` directory relative to the HTML files.

## Usage

1. **Homepage**: Visit the homepage to learn about the project and navigate to other sections.
2. **AR Experience**: Open the AR Experience page to view and interact with the animated 3D models.
3. **Download Markers**: Access the Download Markers page to download marker files for printing and use with the AR application.
